# American Express Customer Segmentation & Insights

This project applies **unsupervised machine learning (K-Means)** on simulated American Express-like customer transaction data to build **5 distinct customer segments** and derive **business insights**.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Synthetic dataset generated to simulate Amex transaction-level, financial, and behavioral data.
- Applied **K-Means clustering** to group customers into 5 segments:
  1. High-Spend Digital First Enterprises
  2. Traditional Large Accounts (Low Digital Adoption)
  3. Mid-Market Growth Firms
  4. Transaction-Heavy, Low Margin Firms
  5. Emerging Businesses with Volatile Spend
- Derived actionable insights for marketing, product, and risk teams.

## 📊 Key Results
- **Segment 2 (Traditional Large Accounts):** Low digital adoption but high travel spend → **+18% revenue growth opportunity**.
- Designed A/B test campaign with personalized outreach & 10% rebate incentive.
- Documented findings in a **Corporate Analytics Glossary**.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `data/` – Sample synthetic dataset.
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for clustering and insights.
- `scripts/` – Python scripts to generate SQL inserts and datasets.
- `results/` – Visualizations, metrics, and exported reports.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
